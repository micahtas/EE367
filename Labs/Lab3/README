University of Hawaii
EE 367L
Lab 3

Included in this directory are files for Lab 3:

*  Data files:  file1.txt, file2.txt, and file3.txt
*  Example files:  server.c, client.c, and pipe.c

You will write a server program named "server367.c".
Each student will have a distinct port number for
their server.  See the project's Assignment in
laulima for your port number.  You will also have
a client program named "client367.c".
You should have a makefile(s) for your programs
so that the executable for the server is "server367"
and the executable for the client is "client367".

Submit your project by having your program files 
(source code and executables) 
in this directory.  This directory should also
have your makefiles, the data files (file1.txt,
file2.txt, and file3.txt), and a README file,
which replaces this README file. The new README
file should include your name, date, an explanation
of what your programs do, and an explanation
of how to compile your programs.

Your directory should be tar'd
and gzipped, and uploaded into laulima.

Instructions:
	Simply run the makefile with the command 'make'
	or 'make all'.

	It will create the output files 'server367.o' and 
	'client367.o'.

	To run the server use 'server367'
	
	To run the client use 'client367 remotehostname' 

	To run with same user id either use
		'client wiliki' 
			or
		'client localhost'
	To run with two users
		find the remotehostname and use
		'client remotehostname'
	

APPLICATION NOTES:
	You can use the #ifdef ACTUAL to run the program 
	exactly how it is supposed to be or using a simpler approach.

	Without defining ACTUAL (keeping "//define ACTUAL" commented),
	The client will ask you to type in the file name after typing
	in the command rather then using the syntax CMD<file_name>, you 
	will be prompted after typing the CMD for a "Enter File Name:"
	This is essentially simpler and more efficient.

	With ACTUAL defined, the client will require the syntax 
	CMD<file_name> when at this prompt "ENTER_CMD:".
	This is not as efficient as the above, but it works properly.
