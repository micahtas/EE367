Contents of the directory:

1.  Subdirectory Data which has data files

2.  datagen.c is the source code that generated the data files
    in subdirectory Data.  You can generate new data files by
    changing some of the macro defines, compiling the program,
    and running it.

3.  sum.c is the source code that processes the data file, and
    in particular it adds all the data values in a file and
    displays it.  The makefile is for this program.

4.  scriptarg and scriptlist are example scripts you should try.
    You can run them by entering "./scriptarg" or "./scriptlist"
    If you create your own script, be sure that the file is
    executable.  Sometimes when creating a file with an editor,
    the file will be read only, or restricted in some way.
    Then you need must change the restrictions using "chmod" 
    so that it can be executed.
